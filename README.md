# My First Blog

## Overview

My First Blog is a personal blog application designed to help users share their thoughts and experiences online. This application features a form for creating blog posts, dynamic rendering of posts, and a light/dark mode toggle for enhanced user experience. The blog is a great starting point for anyone looking to explore web development, particularly with JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Description

This project involves building a personal blog from starter code, focusing on JavaScript to manage form submissions, store data in local storage, and toggle between light and dark modes. The application has a simple, responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and offers a clean interface for users to create and view blog posts.

## Changes Made

Created a form with fields for username, blog title, and content.
Added validation to ensure that all fields are completed before submission.
Implemented JavaScript to handle form submissions, store blog posts in local storage, and render them dynamically on the page.
Developed a light/dark mode toggle that updates the page's styles based on the user's selection.
Added navigation features, including a "Back" button to return to the form and a post display page.

## Mock-up Comparison

The current implementation closely follows the intended mock-up design, with a focus on user interactivity and responsiveness. The layout includes a form for blog submissions, a list of blog posts, and a light/dark mode toggle. The overall functionality aligns with the original goals of the project.
